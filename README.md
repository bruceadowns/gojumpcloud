# go (to) JumpCloud

This project is partial fulfillment of the interview process with [jumpcloud](https://jumpcloud.com).

## Requirements
* The project should be written in Go.
* When launched it should monitor a given port and wait for http connections.
* When a connection is made it should not respond immediately, but rather hold the socket open for 5 seconds and then respond.
* The connection will be a POST request containing a value that the client wishes to be hashed.
* The hashing algorithm should be SHA512
* The result should be returned base64 encoded
* The software should be able to process multiple connections simultaneously.
* To submit your work please invite topherMarie to a GitHub project, and be sure to document any configuration or run instructions.

## Example
For instance, given the request (generated by curl)

`curl --data "password=angryMonkey" http://localhost:8080`

your program should return

`ZEHhWB65gUlzdVwtDQArEyx+KVLzp/aTaRaPlBzYRIFj6vjFdqEb0Q5B8zVKCZ0vKbZPZklJz0Fd7su2A+gf7Q==`

## Clarifications
* POST body is `password=%s` where only %s should be hashed
* Use http only per requirement. No https.
* `curl -X POST --data "password=angryMonkey" http://localhost:8080`
* Assume a reasonable password size and encoding
* Do not worry about read or write timeout values

* `gojumpcloud`

### Query web server
* `curl -X POST --data "password=angryMonkey" http://localhost:8080`

or

* Open http://localhost:8080 in browser

or

* `go test`
* `go test -v`
* `GOJUMPCLOUD_URL=http://localhost:8080 go test -v`
* `GOJUMPCLOUD_COUNT=10 GOJUMPCLOUD_URL=http://localhost:8080 go test -v`
